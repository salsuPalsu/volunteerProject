# volunteerProject
This is a very simple user interface, designed to help volunteers keep up with information about distributed goods, to make sure everyone has had their share. Every person coming to collect food etc. is given a serial number. With this number, the volunteer specifies how many family members this person has, and saves it in the interface. This determines how much this person might need food or items, such as children's bicycles. When the person is given something, it is inserted in the interface, where the volunteers can check the given items when necessary. The data is saved on a txt file. The user can add multiple new codes by using a CSV-format. This project was made for a specific program, for specific needs.
